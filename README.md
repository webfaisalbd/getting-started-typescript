# `Getting started typescriopt` 


### `install`

### `compiling ts file` 

`if you have single ts file, then try it`
after compile, you get a js file, then connect js file instead of ts file.

```javascript
npx tsc fileName.js

```

`if you have multiple ts file, then try it`
after compile, you get a tsconfig.json ,

```javascript
npx tsc --init

```

`In every edit in your code, you have to re-compile`
```javascript
npx tsc fileName.js

```
